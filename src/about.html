    Club merely a four-letter word but holds a great meaning inside it. As the name suggests it teaches us to work in a team. In ELECTRONICS AND ROBOTICS CLUB we deal with electronics and robot construction or automation of any hardware. Students who are interested in learning about and working with robots can become a part of this club. In college, robotics clubs typically take place after college, in a classroom. It is OF THE STUDENT, FOR THE STUDENT and BY THE STUDENT group. Faculty coordinators are in supporting role. There are also competitions and workshops related to robotics. At robotics competitions, teams of students design and build a robot that can compete in a series of specific challenges and are motivated to represent college.

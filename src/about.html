    <b>CLUB</b> merely a four-letter word but holds a great meaning inside it. As the name suggests it teaches us to work in a team. In <b>ELECTRONICS AND ROBOTICS CLUB</b> we deal with electronics and robot construction or automation of any hardware. Students who are interested in learning about and working with robots can become a part of this club. In college, robotics clubs typically take place after college, in a classroom. It is <b>OF THE STUDENT, FOR THE STUDENT and BY THE STUDENT</b> group. Faculty coordinators are in supporting role. There are also competitions and workshops related to robotics. At robotics competitions, teams of students design and build a robot that can compete in a series of specific challenges and are motivated to represent college.

         In this session, Teams were explained and given task to make Obstacle Avoiding Robot.<br>
         It is a car which senses any obstacle in front of it and manipulate its motion to avoid any collision.<br>
         Ultrasonic sensor placed at the front most panel of that car is used to sense the obstacle.</td>
